  🚀 How It Works

  1. Customer Context: Each customer has their own database, domain, and configuration
  2. Dynamic Switching: Chatbot can switch between customers in real-time
  3. Schema Isolation: Each domain (ecommerce, inventory) has its own schema and prompts
  4. Database Isolation: Each customer gets their own MongoDB database

  💼 Sample Customers Created

  - TechMart Electronics (ecommerce) - Medium electronics retailer
  - Warehouses Inc (inventory) - Large logistics company
  - Shopify Plus Store (ecommerce) - Enterprise multi-category store
